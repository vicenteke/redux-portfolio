Alternatively, click on the rooms and links to do the exact same thing. The mobile versions mimics the desktop in the sense that you should "move" through rooms, rather than "skipping" to the last one.</>

Moreover, it was like a study for me, as I could practice some new technologies for me (fundamentally React and Redux at the time I'm witting this).</>
